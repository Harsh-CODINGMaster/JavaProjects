This is a project based on WebD mainly using HTML, CSS, JS.
There are 2 options in the main screen dashboard which asks the player to opt for if he/she wants to play first turn or CPU should.
The game has been designed beautifully using MiniMax algorithm in which Palyer can't win, either CPU will win or it will be a tie.
